    <h1> The MTA Still Struggles to Recover From Losses, Five Years After Covid-19 </h1>
    <!-- DEK/SUBHED -->
    <h3> Reports from the MTA show that the agency still has a long way to go recover losses to its operating budget from decreased ridership. </h3>

    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
    <p> TThe MTA has not fully recovered from the loss of transit riders before the pandemic. Between 2020 and 2021, the population of New York City decreased by more than <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/planning/downloads/pdf/our-work/reports/new-york-city-population-estimates-and-trends_may-2025.pdf" target="_blank">350,000 people</a>,  4% of the population. According to reports from the New York State Comptroller, in 2019, fares and tolls covered 52% of the MTA’s operating budget. But in 2024, it covered only 39% of the operating budget. </p>

<p>Our data shows that over the past five years, the Bronx had the steepest population decline of all boroughs (-2.36%). The borough also had the most underwhelming weekday ridership recovery. The Bronx only had an 11-point jump from 2019 to 2024. This pales in comparison to Manhattan, which had a 35-point jump in ridership. Queens and Brooklyn followed behind with a 31 and 29 point increase, respectively. </p>

<p>This presents a challenge for the <a href="https://www.mta.info/document/91791" target="_blank">MTA, which projected that, in a best-case scenario</a> for increased revenue, New York City would have to recover its population loss from the pandemic, increase the employment rate, and have more workers return to in-person work for more than three days a week. </p>

<p>If this were to happen, the MTA would have a greater chance to recover a significant portion of its 2019 revenue. Under a best-case scenario, the MTA can recoup anywhere from <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-McKinsey-Ridership-Projections-October-2020-De/c6y7-ek5e/about_data" target="_blank">80% to 88% of its 2019 revenue by December 2026</a>, according to McKinsey & Company. This consultant group creates the MTA’s transit forecasts. </p>

<p>This doesn’t happen without the assistance of a fare hike, however. </p>

    <!-- WRAPUP THE STORY HERE -->
    <p>The MTA is raising the fare from $2.90 to $3 starting January 2026 to help cover its operating budget and address fare evasion, rising labor costs, and service improvements. All MetroCards will be retired, and new OMNY card fees will increase from $1 to $2. </p> 

 <p>The upcoming fare hike comes at a time when mayoral-elect Zohran Mamdani has pledged to make MTA buses free, and other neighboring transportation systems have experienced fare hikes in the past year. </p> 

 <p>“The farebox was once 38% of our revenue. Now it is down to 26%,” said Jai Patel, the MTA Chief Financial Officer at November’s board meeting. The CFO said the MTA would take a little longer to recover but is committed to minimizing expenses and to supporting ridership growth. “We're spending less in 2025 than we did in 2019, even as we increase service and support growing ridership. We should be really proud.”
